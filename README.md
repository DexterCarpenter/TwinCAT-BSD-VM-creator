# Setting up the network interface

If VMs network defaults to `NAT`, you may not be able to connect to the PLC. Therefore you should set the virtual network either to `Host-Only Adapter` if you are working with the PLC only from the host computer; or `Bridged Adpater` to set up a physical connection to the outside network.
